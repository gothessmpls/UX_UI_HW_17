<h1>CIVIC HELPER | MOBILE APP</h1>
<p>Civic Helper is a mobile app that makes it easy to discover, schedule and manage volunteer 
  opportunities</p>
<h2>RESEARCH PROCESS</h2>
    <p>Civic Helper is a travel app that took a few weeks in the design process. My team wanted to come
      up with a useful tool to generate more civic engagement. Some creative brainstorming on a Miro 
      board helped us gather some inspiration. There was a drive to design a useful tool that would 
      add value while letting users discover, schedule and manage volunteer opportunities.  
      
      The goal in the research phase was to gain insight into what types of civic engagement users are 
      interested in and their current frustrations with getting involved. We conducted interviews over Zoom. 
      The participants were between the ages of 28-40 who are currently interested in volunteering./p> 
    </p>
    <h2>IDEATION PROCESS</h2>
    <p>User testing sessions were very helpful with providing feedback. This created a list of improvements 
      that could be made. Some of these were the build out of the hamburger menu, and the increase of the 
      font size. Iterations were made to the calendar as well. </p> 
      <h2>TESTING PROCESS</h2>
      <p>Once the user data is collected it will then cultivate a user persona in this next step.This will be the  
        vehicle that brings forth how we can help find a solution that targets the users needs. The user 
        persona will capture the journey of acquiring a service, product, or feature. A thoughtful storyboard 
        can generate solutions which will meet the needs of the user and enhance a products service, 
        or feature. </p> 
        <h2>PROTOTYPE & OPPORTUNITIES </h2>
      <p>In order to get an app that took overall less time for a user to join a volunteer opportunity we needed 
        to add more working visual queues and flexibility to the app. We did this by getting more out of 
        Adobe XD with the features it has so we could have greater usability within fewer sections in the app.
        
        Some great next steps would be to conduct conduct trial runs with local non-profits as a way to 
        introduce the tool to potential users. Once the Civic Helper is fully adopted by users, we believe it 
        will increase the number of times a typical user volunteers each month. Users will be able to use the 
        time they’d normally spend looking for opportunities, actively volunteering.  </p>

        <h1>USDA WEBSITE | RESPONSIVE REDESIGN</h1>
<p>The goal for the USDA redesign was to make it responsive for both mobile & desktop while improving
  on the primary navigation for users. </p>
<h2>RESEARCH PROCESS</h2>
    <p>Users found the websites structure overwhelming. The redesign would address this. The navigation 
      bar would benefit from the latch method. There is a lot of content on website so a card sorting  
      activity would help with a new sitemap structure. All this would serve a purpose in organizing and 
      condensing the content so it wasn’t repetitive on both the desktop & mobile.
       
      Utilizing a Miroboard which comes in handy during this phase. The user insight was organized. 
      Categories and labeling kept things organized, and helped address how we could improve on the
       redesign. We found users disliked the repetitive content on the website. They did not like the 
      endless scrolling on the mobile version either. The desktop was easier to navigate instead of the 
      mobile version. 
    </p>
    <h2>IDEATION PROCESS</h2>
    <p>The data from the research phase was useful in moving forward with defining the problems users 
      were experiencing. The card sorting helped create a new sitemap for the primary navigation & the 
      footer sitemap. This moved us along to style guides and mock ups for testing.
      </p> 
      <h2>TESTING PROCESS</h2>
      <p>Usability surveys were conducted to get feedback on whether the redesign was less overwhelming. 
        Asking users if they found the new look easier to digest was important. Since that was the main 
        concern for many users, was the overwhelming repetitive content..  </p> 
        <h2>PROTOTYPE & OPPORTUNITIES </h2>
      <p>The testing helped implement iterations to the mock up prototypes. Just taking the time to listen we 
        found some good solutions. Such as, adding cards to condense content. Also including a slide show 
        feature. This added engagement with an interactive activity. Stakeholders and users have valuable 
        perspectives. So, Taking in as much insight during this phase is crucial for prototypes. 
        
        Some great steps for this project would be to add some videos  to ease on the overload in content. 
        The online forms can use some updating, possibly having a designated section for just forms would 
        be beneficial for users. </p>

        <h1>COMMUNITY PATHWAYS | RESPONSIVE REDESIGN</h1>
        <p>Community Pathways wanted to create a sign up for their newsletter. They wanted the newsletter to 
          be implemented in the navigation. Included a responsive redesign for both desktop & mobile. </p>
        <h2>RESEARCH PROCESS</h2>
            <p>Early in the process we worked directly with the stakeholder. After some talks and learning more 
              about the non-for profit,  we found out that they wanted to improve on there newsletter sign up.
              We then conducted a complete evaluation of the current website, and found some inconsistencies
               we could improve on. 
               
              It was time to conduct interviews and surveys to gather as much information to help with the redesign. 
              We found that users were unsure of the placement of the newsletter. This highlighted the need for a 
              gentle implementation, of the newsletter in primary navigation.
            </p>
            <h2>IDEATION PROCESS</h2>
            <p>Our user’s experience was then mapped out into a journey map. This covered a wide array of 
              emotions .Our team went through the Card Sorting and Site Map process together.Insight from the
              stakeholder and users interviews was broken into 3 categories. The 3 categories we separated info 
              into were; visual design; features and pains & gains
              </p> 
              <h2>TESTING PROCESS</h2>
              <p>Paper prototypes were created for both  desktop and mobile site. Ideas then got translated to 
                Adobe XD. Next, some guerrilla testing helped with the mid-fidelity prototype. Some A/B testing was 
                used for options on the sign up. Getting this feedback helped with iterations that would help users.</p> 
                <h2>PROTOTYPE & OPPORTUNITIES </h2>
              <p>All of the testing helped with the prototypes iterations. The changes that were made were to the user 
                flow. Adding a “Newsletter” button on the footer helped make the newsletter more apparent.We also 
                minimized the amount of information that users would have to fill in for the sign up through the feed-
                back from the testing.
                .
                The next steps would be to update more of the website. The donation page needs a little bit of love.
                Some added features like a calendar, and creating some accessible online applications would 
                benefit the organization and users greatly.  </p>
